## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates transfer learning with Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification on a subset of the Food-101 dataset. The model classifies images into three categories: **pizza, steak, and sushi**.

**Key Features:**
- Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) with pre-trained weights
- Modular PyTorch code structure
- Transfer learning with frozen backbone
- Training monitoring and visualization
- Model checkpointing and evaluation
